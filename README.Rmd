# bespokelearnr

<!-- badges: start -->

This package generates bespoke learning materials for a workshop-style class that provides an introduction to the emerging field of Data Science in R, including data analysis and visualization. It heavily leverages the `learnr` package, and allows programmatic generation of learning materials.

## Installation

You **cannot**  install bespokelearnr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), so in the meantime, use the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/matthewhirschey/bespokelearnr) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matthewhirschey/bespokelearnr")
```
